Guidelines
- Report bugs or request features via Issues.
- Create a feature branch from `main` named `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
- Keep commits focused and well-described (use imperative tense).
- Open a Pull Request against `main`. Describe what you changed and why.
- Include tests for new functionality where applicable.
- Ensure code follows existing style (use ESLint/Prettier if present).

Local setup
1. Install dependencies:
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
2. Run dev servers:
   - Backend: `npm run dev`
   - Frontend: `npm run dev`
